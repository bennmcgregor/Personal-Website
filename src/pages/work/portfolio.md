1.  A demo of the game engine I developed as an Undergraduate Research Fellow at UWaterloo's Computational Health Informatics Lab. The demo includes an architecture diagram and the Python code. You can access the demo through [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udomw3w6hrmgt0o/AABVPVNwjcfgpFtaS1pCREBda?dl=0). I also authored a paper, "[Trust-ya: design of a multiplayer game for the study of small group processes](https://ieee-cog.org/2021/assets/papers/paper_294.pdf)", about the design of a game running on the engine, published in the IEEE Conference on Games.
