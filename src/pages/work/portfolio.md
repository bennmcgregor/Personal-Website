1.  A demo of the game engine I developed as an Undergraduate Research Fellow at UWaterloo's Computational Health Informatics Lab. The demo includes an architecture diagram and the Python code. You can access the demo through [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udomw3w6hrmgt0o/AABVPVNwjcfgpFtaS1pCREBda?dl=0). I also authored a paper, "[Trust-ya: design of a multiplayer game for the study of small group processes](https://ieee-cog.org/2021/assets/papers/paper_294.pdf)", about the design of a game running on the engine, published in the IEEE Conference on Games.

2.  A machine learning application that gives ratings of posture on the rowing ergometer: [bennmcgregor.com/work/catch-analyzer/](https://bennmcgregor.com/work/catch-analyzer/).

3.  The landing page of my website [bennmcgregor.com](https://bennmcgregor.com), which is a visual representation of my piano playing and the synesthesia I experience when reading musical scores. Press the play button in the top right hand corner to turn on the sound.

4. The UX design for Novii, an online educational platform for learning about the COVID-19 vaccines and other timely and relevant topics. Me and my collaborators published an [article describing our design process](https://medium.com/cs449-649-f21-uwaterloo/cs-449-final-report-c8feba63553f), including background research, ideation, prototyping, and testing. You can also view a [demo video of the finished prototype](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-2qSbndLfD-mEq2eoJ6YrolYc9MZsQqB/view?usp=sharing), which was created with Figma.
