_Catch Posture Analyzer_

A [machine learning application developed on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19qnezblA4nHW4ViMAbLsRJdCR8NUCwrK?usp=sharing) with Keras and TensorFlow for analyzing streamed video of a rower's posture at the catch on an ergometer. The application uses a pipeline of three machine learning models to give a binary classification ("Good" or "Bad" posture) to individual frames of data, which are then passed to the rower in real time. 

Check out the [Google Colab demo document](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19qnezblA4nHW4ViMAbLsRJdCR8NUCwrK?usp=sharing) for a detailed description of the app and a report on my development process.
