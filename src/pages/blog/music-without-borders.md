_Music Without Borders_

I co-created the [Music Without Borders](http://musicwithoutborder.com "Music Without Borders Website") fundraising campaign, which draws on the power of the arts to support the humanitarian work of [Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders (MSF)](http://www.msf.ca/ "MSF Website"). It's a completely student-run project that has raised more than $44,000 and engaged hundreds of youth since 2014. It continues to engage high school students from diverse interests and backgrounds across North America.
