I recently came across that beautiful, evocative quote from Virginia Woolf's [_The Waves_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waves). It reminded me of John Adams' [_Harmonielehre_](https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/mar/11/symphony-guide-john-adams-harmonielehre-tom-service), which perfectly captures the feeling of this, particularly in the last movement:

</div>

John Adams is one of my favourite composers, and that quote is a great starting point for exploring his music. Like much of his other work, _Harmonielehre_ is surreal, fantastic, and modern. You can read more about it in John Adams' own [piece description](https://www.earbox.com/harmonielehre/).
