I made these [intaglio prints](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/intaglio) as a study of a [Norwegian stave church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stave_church) a couple years ago. The process of creating a print involves making a design, etching it onto a copper plate with acid, and experimenting with how the ink is spread onto the plate to bring out different visual elements of the design.

Below are prints that examine the unique architecture of the church in different moods, along with a photograph of the church that inspired the design.
